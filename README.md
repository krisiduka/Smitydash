A SMart cITY DASHboard project

## Introduction

This is a smart city dashboard created for my University thesis. It is intended as a city management tool to be used by a city's officials. In the version I created it helps people that manage Thessaloniki city in Greece, to check local weather and air quality, see available parking spaces and live city cameras, and even track fires.

## Technologies used in this project

For the backend of this dashboard I chose to work with Node.js, using the Express.js framework to create a REST API. I also utilized the power of No-SQL database MongoDB using the Mongoose ODM package to connect my Node.js backend with the database.
For the frontend I used the React library because of its flexibility and convenience of creating interactive web user interfaces.
